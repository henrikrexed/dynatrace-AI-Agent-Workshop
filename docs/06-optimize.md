# 06 — Optimize

This is where the whole workshop pays off. You can now **run** agents (02),
**secure** them (03), **observe** their cost (04), and **evaluate** their quality
(05). Optimization is the loop that uses that evidence to make agents **cheaper
without making them worse**.

!!! quote "The core idea"
    The biggest driver of AI agent cost is **tokens** — and most token spend is
    waste: unused tools inflating every prompt, oversized system prompts, chatty
    multi-hop workflows, and retries. You can't cut what you can't see, which is
    why observation and evaluation came first.

## The optimization loop

```
   observe (04)        evaluate (05)
       │                    │
       ▼                    ▼
   find the waste  ──▶  make one change  ──▶  re-measure cost + quality
       ▲                                            │
       └────────────── keep only if quality holds ──┘
```

Change one thing, re-run the eval suite, and keep the change **only if quality
holds and cost dropped**. Never optimize on cost alone — that's how you ship a
cheap agent that gives wrong answers.

## 1. Rank your agents by spend

From Dynatrace AI Observability (module 04), find your most expensive agents —
total tokens and estimated cost per run. Start at the top of that list; a 20%
cut on your priciest agent beats a 50% cut on a rarely-used one.

## 2. The four highest-leverage cuts

### a) Remove tools the agent never uses

Every tool an agent is granted is described in **every** prompt sent to the
model — that's input tokens on every single call, whether the tool is used or
not. In the traces, look at which tools an agent *actually* calls over many runs;
anything never called is pure overhead.

Trim the agent's `toolNames` to only what it uses:

```yaml
# agents/sre/sre-agent.yaml (illustrative)
spec:
  tools:
    - type: McpServer
      mcpServer:
        toolNames:        # ← keep only the tools this agent actually calls
          - list_pods
          - get_logs
          - dql_query
          # dropped: a dozen k8s tools the SRE agent never invoked
```

Re-apply (`bash agents/install-agents.sh`), send the same prompts, and compare
input-token counts in Dynatrace. Fewer tools → smaller prompts → lower cost on
*every* call.

### b) Tighten the system prompt

A rambling system prompt is a fixed tax on every request. Shorten it to the
essentials; move examples out unless they measurably improve the eval score.

### c) Fix chatty workflows

In a BMAD run, the span waterfall (module 04) shows how many A2A hops and LLM
calls a task took. Redundant hand-offs, an agent that re-reads context it already
has, or a loop that retries silently all show up as extra `gen_ai` spans. Collapse
the hops that don't earn their tokens.

### d) Right-size the model per agent

Not every agent needs the most capable model. kagent makes the model a
one-line `ModelConfig` reference, so you can point a cheap, mechanical agent
(e.g. a formatter) at a smaller/cheaper model while the reasoning-heavy
orchestrator keeps the stronger one. This workshop already defaults the whole
crew to **DeepSeek** for cost; per-agent tuning goes further.

```yaml
# agents/mcp/00-modelconfig.yaml — the shared workshop-llm (DeepSeek, cost-first)
# Create a second, cheaper ModelConfig and reference it from the agents that
# don't need the strong model. One field per agent: spec.modelConfig.
```

## 3. Prove the win

For each change, run the dt-evals suite (module 05) **before and after**:

| Metric | Before | After | Keep? |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Avg tokens / task | — | — | — |
| Est. cost / task | — | — | — |
| Eval pass rate | — | — | ✅ only if ≥ before |

!!! success "The rule"
    Ship the change when **cost went down and the eval pass rate did not**. If
    quality dropped, revert — the cheaper agent that's wrong is more expensive
    than the costly one that's right.

## 4. Make it continuous

Optimization isn't a one-off. Because cost and quality are now both telemetry:

- Keep the dt-evals suite in CI as a **regression + budget gate** on every agent
  change.
- Watch the Dynatrace AI Observability cost trend; alert when an agent's
  tokens-per-task drifts up.
- Re-rank your agents periodically — usage patterns change, and today's cheap
  agent is tomorrow's top spender.

## What you achieved (acceptance)

- You identified the most expensive agents from real telemetry.
- You applied at least one concrete cut (unused tools / prompt / hops / model)
  and **proved** with evals that quality held while cost fell.
- You have a repeatable loop — observe → evaluate → change → re-measure — to keep
  agents cost-efficient in production.

## You've completed the arc

**Why → kagent → cluster → agents → secure → observe → evaluate → optimize.**
You built a full, cost-efficient AI-agent platform on Kubernetes and have the
telemetry and evals to keep it that way.
