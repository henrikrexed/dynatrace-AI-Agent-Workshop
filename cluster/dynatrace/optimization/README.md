# Phase 5 · AI Agent Optimization artifacts (ISI-6720)

Dynatrace artifacts that turn the kagent crew's `gen_ai.*` spans into an
**understand-first** read of a single agent run (ISI-6976), the three
optimization signals from **[`docs/07-optimize.md`](../../../docs/07-optimize.md)**
(token spend, unused tools, inefficient loops), a reproducible **before/after**
story, and a **continuous guardian** that gates cost + quality regressions.

All are **dtctl-ready YAML** — `dtctl apply`/`dtctl create` straight from this
directory. Every DQL/SLI was validated against live crew telemetry before
commit. **Start with `ai-agent-workflow-steps.notebook.yaml`** — it walks one run
from the crew list down to the per-hop token bill, so you read what the agent is
doing before you cut it.

| File | Kind | Deploy |
|------|------|--------|
| `ai-agent-workflow-steps.notebook.yaml` | Notebook (**understand first**) | `dtctl create notebook -f ai-agent-workflow-steps.notebook.yaml` |
| `ai-agent-optimization.dashboard.yaml` | Dashboard | `dtctl apply -f ai-agent-optimization.dashboard.yaml` |
| `ai-agent-optimization-before-after.notebook.yaml` | Notebook (**then cut cost**) | `dtctl create notebook -f ai-agent-optimization-before-after.notebook.yaml` |
| `ai-agent-quality-cost.guardian.yaml` | Site Reliability Guardian (settings) | `dtctl create settings -f ai-agent-quality-cost.guardian.yaml --schema app:dynatrace.site.reliability.guardian:guardians --scope environment` |
| `ai-agent-optimization.workflow.yaml` | Workflow (scheduled guardian run) | `dtctl create workflow -f ai-agent-optimization.workflow.yaml` |
| `tool-grants.lookup.json` | Lookup table (tools each agent is granted) | embedded inline in the dashboard/notebook coverage query — no deploy needed (or upload as a native Dynatrace lookup table) |

## Prerequisites

- A Dynatrace tenant receiving OTLP from the Phase 2/3 cluster (the kagent crew
  emits `gen_ai.*` spans under `service.namespace == "kagent"`).
- `dtctl` authenticated against that tenant
  (`dtctl config use-context <your-context>`; verify with `dtctl auth whoami`).

## Deploy (in order)

> **Render your attendee prefix first (shared tenant).** Every DQL below scopes on
> `workshop.attendee == "${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}"` and the SRE agent's prefixed
> `service.name == "${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}-sre-agent"` (ISI-6986), so each attendee sees
> only their own data. The YAML carries the literal `${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}` — render it
> with `envsubst` (the same prefix you set at Codespace create) before `dtctl`, e.g.
> `envsubst '${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}' < file.yaml > file.rendered.yaml`. The loop below
> renders all five into `./.rendered/` and deploys from there.

```bash
dtctl config use-context <your-tenant>
: "${WORKSHOP_PREFIX:?set WORKSHOP_PREFIX to your attendee prefix first}"

# Render ${WORKSHOP_PREFIX} into every asset (scoped envsubst; leaves other $refs intact)
mkdir -p .rendered
for f in ai-agent-workflow-steps.notebook.yaml ai-agent-optimization.dashboard.yaml \
         ai-agent-optimization-before-after.notebook.yaml ai-agent-quality-cost.guardian.yaml \
         ai-agent-optimization.workflow.yaml; do
  envsubst '${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}' < "$f" > ".rendered/$f"
done

# 0 · Read-the-run notebook (understand one agent run before cutting anything)
dtctl create notebook -f .rendered/ai-agent-workflow-steps.notebook.yaml

# 1 · Dashboard + notebook (find the waste, tell the before/after story)
dtctl apply -f .rendered/ai-agent-optimization.dashboard.yaml
dtctl create notebook -f .rendered/ai-agent-optimization-before-after.notebook.yaml

# 2 · Guardian (the continuous cost + quality gate)
dtctl create settings -f .rendered/ai-agent-quality-cost.guardian.yaml \
  --schema app:dynatrace.site.reliability.guardian:guardians --scope environment

# 3 · Workflow that runs the guardian daily. It references the guardian by
#     objectId — after step 2, grab the new objectId and set it in the workflow:
dtctl get settings --schema app:dynatrace.site.reliability.guardian:guardians \
  -o json --plain | grep -B2 "AI Agent Quality"      # -> objectId
#     edit .rendered/ai-agent-optimization.workflow.yaml -> tasks.run_validation.input.objectId
dtctl create workflow -f .rendered/ai-agent-optimization.workflow.yaml
```

> The workflow ships with its schedule **disabled**
> (`trigger.schedule.isActive: false`). Flip it to `true` to go continuous.

The dashboard/notebook YAML carry **no `id`** — the server assigns one on first
deploy. To *update* a dashboard later, download it first
(`dtctl get dashboard <id> -o yaml --plain > file.yaml`), edit, and re-`apply` —
this preserves UI edits.

## UI import (no dtctl)

Prefer the Dynatrace UI? Download the **UI-importable JSON** and upload it in
your own tenant — same artifacts, no CLI. The JSON is **generated** from the
YAML above by [`scripts/gen-optimization-json.sh`](../../../scripts/gen-optimization-json.sh)
(via `yq -o=json`) and is never hand-maintained, so the two paths cannot drift
(a CI regen-diff guard enforces it).

| Artifact | Download | Import from |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Dashboard | [ai-agent-optimization.dashboard.json](../../../docs/assets/optimization/ai-agent-optimization.dashboard.json) | Dashboards → **Upload** |
| Notebook (before/after) | [ai-agent-optimization-before-after.notebook.json](../../../docs/assets/optimization/ai-agent-optimization-before-after.notebook.json) | Notebooks → **Upload** |
| Workflow | [ai-agent-optimization.workflow.json](../../../docs/assets/optimization/ai-agent-optimization.workflow.json) | Workflows → **Upload** |

Two one-time edits before uploading (the same rendering the `dtctl` path does):

1. **Prefix** — the dashboard/notebook JSON still carry the literal
   `${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}`. Find/replace it with your attendee prefix before upload
   (the `dtctl` path does this via `envsubst`).
2. **Guardian objectId** — the workflow JSON carries the reference tenant's
   guardian `objectId` (base64). After you create your own guardian, repoint it:
   `dtctl get settings --schema app:dynatrace.site.reliability.guardian:guardians -o json --plain | grep -B2 "AI Agent Quality"`
   gives the new `objectId` — paste it into `tasks.run_validation.input.objectId`.

The **guardian** stays Settings/dtctl-only (there is no UI "upload a guardian"
surface); create it with the `dtctl create settings` command above.

## The guardian

A Site Reliability Guardian is the regression gate behind the optimization loop.
Three DQL objectives, all validated against live telemetry:

| Objective | SLI (crew, LLM-call spans) | Rule | target / warning |
|-----------|----------------------------|------|------------------|
| Cost per LLM call | avg input tokens / call | `<=` | 20000 / 18000 |
| Loop efficiency | avg LLM-call hops / task | `<=` | 5 / 4 |
| Answer substance (quality proxy) | avg output tokens / call | `>=` | 200 / 300 |

> **Which span is an "LLM call"?** The SLIs no longer filter on
> `span.name == "call_llm"` — on the current kagent/ADK emission that guard
> silently zeroed token sums. They now key on `isNotNull(gen_ai.usage.*_tokens)`:
> any span carrying usage tokens *is* an LLM call. Same correction is applied to
> the dashboard and notebook so all assets stay in lockstep.

The quality proxy backstops the cost cuts: an agent that got "cheaper" by
emitting empty/truncated answers trips it. For the **LLM-judge** quality gate
(relevance, faithfulness, hallucination), pair this with the Phase-4 dt-evals
suite ([`evals/dt-evals`](../../../evals/dt-evals)) — that is the complementary
gate the workflow narrative references.

## Tool-coverage lookup — never-called tools (ISI-6972)

`tool-grants.lookup.json` is the source-of-truth table of every tool each agent
is **granted** (generated from `agents/sre/sre-agent.yaml` and
`agents/bmad-crew/*.yaml` `toolNames`). The dashboard's **Tool coverage** tile
and the notebook's **tool-coverage** cell left-join it against the tools an agent
**actually called** in traces and flag the zero-call rows — the prime "remove
tools the agent never uses" cut:

```
data record(tool = "k8s_get_resources"), record(tool = "k8s_describe_resource"), … /* the agent's granted set */
| lookup [
    fetch spans
    | filter workshop.attendee == "${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}" and service.namespace == "kagent"
        and service.name == "${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}-sre-agent"
        and gen_ai.operation.name == "execute_tool" and gen_ai.tool.name != "(merged tools)"
    | summarize calls = count(), by:{tool = gen_ai.tool.name}
  ], sourceField:tool, lookupField:tool, prefix:"called_"
| fieldsAdd calls = coalesce(called_calls, 0)
| fieldsAdd verdict = if(calls == 0, "NEVER CALLED — drop candidate", else: "used")
| sort calls asc
```

- The granted set is embedded **inline** (`data record(...)`) so the query is
  self-contained — no table upload required. The JSON file is the maintainable
  source you regenerate the inline block from when `toolNames` changes.
- The per-agent `service.name` filter is **intentional** (coverage is a per-agent
  question). To score another agent, swap the `service.name` and the inline rows
  for that agent (filter the JSON on `agent`/`traceServiceName`).
- The `tool` join key must match `gen_ai.tool.name` as emitted on your tenant.
  On the shared tenant the SRE agent's `service.name` arrives prefixed as
  `${WORKSHOP_PREFIX}-sre-agent` (ISI-6986); the `tool-grants.lookup.json`
  `traceServiceName` rows still carry the legacy single-tenant `seta_sre_investigator`
  value and are informational only (the coverage join keys on `tool`, not on the
  service name). The `k8s_*` names are confirmed in the reference
  tenant; the `bmad_*` service names follow the observed `bmad_<role>` pattern —
  confirm them (and whether GitHub-MCP tool names are prefixed) before trusting a
  crew-wide join.

## Reference deployment (ISI-6720)

First deployed to `oat05854.dev.apps.dynatracelabs.com`:

- Dashboard `70385f20-36c4-4a82-bf33-eef1a2d03855`
- Notebook `600cc6ab-8874-40ad-8e80-8a9c24806084`
- Guardian `de5dde8f-c585-3e6a-a115-daa7f4d263ca`
- Workflow `70bebb93-12ab-45bd-abff-3d2997dced2b`

Queries carry no hard-coded dashboard time filter — the dashboard time-picker
and notebook section timeframes drive the window (that is how you switch between
the *before* and *after* windows). The guardian/workflow use an explicit 24h
validation window.
