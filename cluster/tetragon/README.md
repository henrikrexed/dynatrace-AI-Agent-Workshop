# cluster/tetragon — Tetragon (eBPF runtime security)

Installs Tetragon (`cilium/tetragon`) to observe — and optionally enforce —
process-execution and network behaviour of the agent workloads via eBPF. This is
module 5 of the workshop learning arc (securing agents).

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `values.yaml` | Helm values for `cilium/tetragon` (DaemonSet + operator, trimmed). |
| `sensitive-file-access.yaml` | `TracingPolicyNamespaced` (observe-only) that posts an event when any process in `agent-sandbox` reads a credential path (service-account token, secrets, `/etc/shadow`, SSH keys, kubeconfig). Applied by hand in module 03. |
| `validate-live.sh` | Reproducible live check: kind + Tetragon + the policy + the loop-snoop pod, asserting the `process_kprobe` event fires and printing the raw `getevents` line. Run by the CI job below. |

## eBPF on kind (important)

kind nodes are containers sharing the **Codespace host kernel**. Tetragon
loads its BPF programs into that kernel, which needs BTF (`/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`)
and permission to attach probes. On most GitHub Codespaces hosts this works.

If the DaemonSet pods CrashLoop or stay `NotReady`:

1. Check the logs: `kubectl -n tetragon logs ds/tetragon -c tetragon`.
2. Confirm host BTF: `ls /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` inside a node container.
3. **Fallback:** run Tetragon in process-visibility-only mode (no enforcement) or
   document it as a known Codespace-kernel limitation for the workshop. Enforcement
   (`TracingPolicy` with `Sigkill`) may be unavailable on a restricted host kernel.

## Demo (Phase 3+)

Once an agent runs in `agent-sandbox`, apply a `TracingPolicy` and watch exec/
network events with `kubectl -n tetragon exec ds/tetragon -c tetragon -- tetra getevents -o compact`.

For the sensitive-file detection step:

```bash
kubectl apply -f cluster/tetragon/sensitive-file-access.yaml
kubectl -n tetragon exec ds/tetragon -c tetragon -- \
  tetra getevents -o compact --namespace agent-sandbox
```

Then trigger it from a sandbox pod that reads credentials **in a loop** — so the
read always lands inside the live `getevents` watch window (a one-shot `cat` can
fire before you attach, and `getevents` never replays history):

```bash
kubectl -n agent-sandbox run snoop --image=busybox:1.36 --restart=Never \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"snoop","image":"busybox:1.36","securityContext":{"allowPrivilegeEscalation":false,"runAsNonRoot":true,"runAsUser":65534,"capabilities":{"drop":["ALL"]},"seccompProfile":{"type":"RuntimeDefault"}},"command":["sh","-c","while true; do cat /etc/passwd /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token >/dev/null 2>&1; sleep 2; done"]}]}}' \
  --command -- sh -c 'while true; do cat /etc/passwd /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token >/dev/null 2>&1; sleep 2; done'

kubectl -n agent-sandbox delete pod snoop --ignore-not-found   # clean up after you see the event
```

`/etc/passwd` is a real path on the container rootfs (no symlink indirection) and
is in the policy's prefix list, so it is guaranteed to match; the service-account
token is the realistic credential-theft target. See module 03 →
*Detect an agent reading sensitive files* for the full walkthrough.

A `cluster/tetragon/validate-live.sh` harness (and the
`.github/workflows/tetragon-sensitive-file.yml` CI job that runs it on a real
kind cluster) exercises this exact flow end-to-end and asserts the
`process_kprobe` event fires — see that script for the live evidence.

## Verify

```bash
kubectl -n tetragon get pods    # tetragon DaemonSet + tetragon-operator Ready
```
